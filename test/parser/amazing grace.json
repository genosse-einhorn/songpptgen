        "1": "Amazing grace! How sweet the sound\nthat saved a wretch like me!\nI once was lost, but now am found;\nwas blind, but now I see.",
        "2": "'t was grace that taught my heart to fear,\nand grace my fears relieved;\nhow precious did that grace appear\nthe hour I first believed.",
        "3": "Through many dangers, toils, and snares,\nI have already come;\n'tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,\nand grace will lead me home.",
        "4": "The Lord has promised good to me,\nhis word my hope secures;\nhe will my shield and portion be,\nas long as life endures.",
        "5": "Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,\nand mortal life shall cease,\nI shall possess, within the veil,\na life of joy and peace.",
        "6": "When we've been there ten thousand years,\nbright shining as the sun,\nwe've no less days to sing God's praise\nthan when we'd first begun."
