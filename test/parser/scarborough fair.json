            "Tell her to wash it in yonder well,\nParsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;\nWhere never sprung water or rain ever fell,\nAnd she shall be a true lover of mine.\n\nTell her to dry it on yonder thorn,\nParsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;\nWhich never bore blossom since Adam was born,\nThen she shall be a true lover of mine."

            "Now he has asked me questions three,\nParsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;\nI hope he'll answer as many for me,\nBefore he shall be a true lover of mine.\n\n\nTell him to buy me an acre of land,\nParsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;\nBetween the salt water and the sea sand,\nThen he shall be a true lover of mine.",
            "Tell him to plough it with a ram's horn,\nParsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;\nAnd sow it all over with one peppercorn,\nAnd he shall be a true lover of mine.\n\nTell him to sheer't with a sickle of leather,\nParsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;\nAnd bind it up with a peacock's feather,\nAnd he shall be a true lover of mine.",
            "Tell him to thrash it on yonder wall,\nParsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme,\nAnd never let one corn of it fall,\nThen he shall be a true lover of mine.\n\nWhen he has done and finished his work.\nParsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme:\nOh, tell him to come and he'll have his shirt,\nAnd he shall be a true lover of mine."
